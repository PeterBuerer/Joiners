# Joiners

## What is a joiner?
"Joiner" is the word used by artist David Hockney to describe the photo collages he made as a response to his dissatisfaction with the medium of singular photographs.

## About this app
This app is intended to allow you to create digital joiners. It is currently a work in progress, but it does allow you to add and position images, as well as save a joiner.
